## What I Learn

1. Flow of using SDL2: init --> create window --> create surface --> playing around --> free surface --> destroy window --> quit
2. To load image, use SDL_LoadBMP and pass the BMP image file path
3. `SDL_Window`: hold the display graphics
4. `SDL_Surface`: a data/image that we want to render to the display/window
5. `SDL_BlitSurface`: copy image from one surface to another
