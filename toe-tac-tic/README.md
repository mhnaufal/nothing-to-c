# Toe-Tac-Tic ðŸ§©

I like playing strategic games, and Tic-Tac-Toe is one of the HARDEST strategic game human evermade :)

## Instructions

This game is played with 2 players, and each player play their turn and take action by giving an "O" or "X" on an empty tiles.

1. 1st player take turn, and enter the number of rows (1-3) and also columns (1-3) to choose
2. 2nd player take turn, and enter the number of rows (1-3) and also columns (1-3) to choose that still empty
3. Repeat the steps 1 and 2 until there is a winner or ended with draw

## Future Works

1. Customize the tile size
2. ~~Add "Play again" button~~
3. Add "vs bot mode"
4. Add unique game modes
5. Always show tile
6. Add unique powerups
